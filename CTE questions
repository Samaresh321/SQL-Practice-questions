--- Write a query to print the name of department along with the total salary paid in each department
--- Normal approach

SELECT d.dept_name, tmp.total_salary 
from (select dept_id,sum(salary) as total_salary from amazon_employees group by dept_id) tmp 
inner join 
department d ON tmp.dept_id=d.dept_id;

--- WIth CTE 

with dept_wise_salary as (select dept_id,sum(salary) as total_salary from amazon_employees group by dept_id)  
SELECT d.dept_name, tmp.total_salary 
from  dept_wise_salary tmp
inner join 
department d ON tmp.dept_id=d.dept_id;


--- Write a Query to generate numbers from 1 to 10 in SQL
 
with recursive generate_number as(
    SELECT 1 as n 
    UNION
    SELECT n+1 FROM generate_number where n<10
)

SELECT * FROM generate_number;
